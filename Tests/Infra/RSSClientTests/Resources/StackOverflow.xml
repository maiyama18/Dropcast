      <description><![CDATA[<p>In complex service-oriented architectures, failure can happen in individual servers and containers, then cascade through your system.

That’s where chaos engineering comes in, injecting failures and uncertainty into complex systems so your team can see where your architecture breaks. </p><p>On this sponsored episode, our fourth in the series with Intuit, Ben and Ryan chat with Deepthi Panthula, Senior Product Manager, and Shan Anwar, Principal Software Engineer, both of Intuit about how use self-serve chaos engineering tools to control the blast radius of failures, how game day tests and drills keep their systems resilient, and how their investment in open-source software powers their program. </p><p><strong>Episode notes: </strong></p><p>Sometimes old practices work in new environments. The Intuit team uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis">Failure Mode Effect Analysis, (FMEA)</a>, a procedure developed by the US military in 1949, to ensure that their developers understand possible points of failure before code makes it to production. </p><p>The team uses <a href="https://litmuschaos.io/">Litmus Chaos</a> to inject failures into their Kubernetes-based system and power their chaos engineering efforts.

      <title>How Intuit improves security, latency, and development velocity with a service mesh</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>At an SaaS company like Intuit that has hundreds of services spread out across multiple products, maintaining development velocity at scale means baking some of the features that every service needs into the architecture of their systems. That’s where a service mesh comes in. It automatically adds features like observability, traffic management, and security to every service in the network without adding any code. </p><p>In this sponsored episode of the podcast, we talk with Anil Attuluri, principal software engineer, and Yasen Simeonov, senior product manager, both of Intuit, about how their engineering organization uses a service mesh to solve problems, letting their engineers stay focused on writing business logic. Along the way, we discuss how the service mesh keeps all the financial data secure, how it moves network traffic to where it needs to go, and the open source software they’ve written on top of the mesh. </p><p>Episode notes:</p><p>For those looking to get the same service mesh capabilities as Intuit, check out <a href="https://istio.io/latest/">Istio</a>, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project. </p><p>In order to provide a better security posture for their products, each business case operates on a discrete network. But much of the Istio service mesh needs to discover services across all products. Enter <a href="https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/admiral">Admiral</a>, their open-sourced solution. </p><p>When Intuit deploys a new service version, they can progressively scale the amount of traffic that hits it instead of the old version using <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/rollouts/">Argo Rollouts</a>.

      <title>The next step in ecommerce? Replatform with APIs and micro frontends</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>SPONSORED BY COMMERCE LAYER</p><p>Around the world, billions of people can sell their wares online, in part thanks to solutions that handle the complexities of securely and reliably managing transactions. Businesses, large and small, can sell directly to customers. But a lot of these ecommerce services provide a heavier surface than many need by managing product catalogs and requiring inflexible interfaces. </p><p>On this sponsored podcast episode, Ben and Ryan talk with Filippo Conforti, co-founder of Commerce Layer, an API-only ecommerce platform that focuses on the transaction engine.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SPONSORED BY COMMERCE LAYER</p><p>Around the world, billions of people can sell their wares online, in part thanks to solutions that handle the complexities of securely and reliably managing transactions. Businesses, large and small, can sell directly to customers. But a lot of these ecommerce services provide a heavier surface than many need by managing product catalogs and requiring inflexible interfaces. </p><p>On this sponsored podcast episode, Ben and Ryan talk with Filippo Conforti, co-founder of Commerce Layer, an API-only ecommerce platform that focuses on the transaction engine.

      <title>Ready to optimize your JavaScript with Rust?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Webpack has been king for several years. Vercel wants folks to embrace Turbopack, but their claims about speed raised a lot of backlash after it was first announced. Lee explains why he thinks the Rust-based approach will ultimately be a big benefit to developers and how organizations who are deeply ingrained with existing tools can safely and incrementally migrate to what is, for now, a very Alpha and experimental release. </p><p>We go over the routing and rendering updates in Next.JS 13, exploring where it might offer developers more flexibility and the ability to use React server components to ship less, maybe a lot less, JavaScript. As Lee says in the episode: </p><p><i>“So to your point about wanting to ship less JavaScript, that was a kinda fundamental architectural decision of where we headed with the app directory. And the core of this is because it's built on React server components. </i></p><p><i>The key thing with React server components is that as your application grows in size from one component to a hundred thousand components, the amount of client-side JavaScript you send can be exactly the same. It can be constant because you can render every single component on the server. </i></p><p><i>And that's a lot different from the world of React applications today, where every new component you add for data fetching or just putting some HTML on the screen also adds additional client-side JavaScript.</i></p><p><i>So this is kind of inverting the default, back from the client to be server first. Now, of course, we still love client-side interactivity that React provides making really interactive and rich UI experiences, but the default for data fetching or just getting HTML to the browser happens from the server, and that's gonna help us reduce the amount of JavaScript.”</i></p><p>You can learn more about Lee on his <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPWX3lpxiLvRRbgoGJFDqyHc1OVBvwc_3uWDIAEjko8/edit?usp=sharing">website</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leeerob/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/leeerob?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a>.

      <itunes:summary>Over the last few years, Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear that he wants his company to be at the forefront of building the Metaverse, and that to do it, the tools and technologies underpinning VR and AR  have to be open source. Facebook has seen great success with open source projects like React, so what does it mean, tactically, for developers who want to contribute to their VR ambitions?

On today’s podcast episode, we’re joined by Cami Williams, Engineering Manager for Platform and Reality Labs Advocacy at Meta. Cami has done the full FAANG tour with engineering roles at Apple, Google, and Amazon. But let’s be real, her most important job title has been our co-host Cassidy Williams’s sister.

      <title>Hashgraph: The sustainable alternative to blockchain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When most people talk about Web3 or cryptocurrencies and related technologies, they usually mean blockchains. But blockchain is only the first generation of distributed ledger technology (DLT). As with any new technology, once people see how it works, new generations come along rapidly to address the faults in the previous ones. </p><p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, Ben and Ryan chat with Matt Woodward, head of developer relations at <a href="https://swirldslabs.com/">Swirlds Labs</a>.

Imagine an internet where it&apos;s easy to provide just the data you want or need to exchange. Envision being able to protect your anonymity, no questions asked.

Shoemaker isn’t exactly new to the topic of turning points for the web. He grew up in Cupertino, around the corner from Apple headquarters. His dad was an engineer at IBM. He eventually ended up working for Apple in 2009 where he helped the company navigate one of the biggest turning points in internet history — the launch of the App Store

In today’s podcast episode, we reflect on Shoemaker’s career experiences and discuss why he’s now focused on decentralized networks of trust.

      <itunes:summary>At some point, a lot of developers think about becoming entrepreneurs. Some end up taking the jump. So what happens when it turns out that nobody wants your product?

Cara Borenstein, co-founder at Stashpad, ended up in this exact situation. After a two year stint as a software engineer at Twilio, she saw an opportunity to create a notepad for developers to stay on top of context switching and manage knowledge-related tasks. V. 1 was a wiki that didn’t quite catch on.

Embracing this reality, Borenstein and her team decided to dig deeper by talking with target customers. That process catalyzed a transformation of the core product into something people need and love, a second brain for busy developers that helps them stay focused and retain those stray thoughts that can add up to something big later on.

      <itunes:summary>Being a technologist is more than a 9-5 job. It’s a lifestyle. That’s why so many of us, like the mad scientists we are, get into homelabbing.

What does this hobby/obsession entail?  Build a home lab to help you level-up your tinkering game. Think: media servers, Raspberry Pis, data centers—turning your home into an IT paradise guaranteed to make you more productive, if only it wasn&apos;t so enticing to work on.

Today’s podcast episode is all about brainstorming fun ideas for homelabbing. Matt, Ceora, and Cassidy host a discussion with JJ Asghar, Developer Advocate at IBM.

      <itunes:summary>On Freund was one of the minds behind the scenes of the now-iconic WeWork startup story. He held three roles at the company: VP of Engineering, VP of Product, and Global Head of Markets at WeWork Labs. The software his team built demonstrated rigor, engineering grit, and strong logic. It’s the reason why WeWork is, at its core, a tech company.

Now, Freund has entered into a new season of his career as co-founder and CEO of Wilco, which is a platform for developers of every skill level to advance in their talents and career journeys. Like a flight simulator, it offers challenges that are meant to prepare developers for the realities of what they will face on the job, moving beyond what they might learn in a classroom or boot camp to scenarios taken from real workplace experiences.

      <itunes:author>Stack Overflow</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>00:28:54</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, Ben and Ryan talk with Matthew Groves, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Couchbase, and Cory House, the founder of Reactjsconsulting.com and a Pluralsight course author, about how to increase velocity without increasing pressure on your engineers, whether cloud native technologies can help (or hurt), and how to design your toolchain so it improves velocity.

When some people hear the phrase “developer velocity,” they cringe and think about delivering an increasingly large number of story points during a sprint. Others push to tighten feedback loops for engineers in order to remove the roadblocks between writing code and getting it into production. But few will understand that much of the “feedback” in that loop is human, so giving them a little more slack lets them provide feedback faster. After all, if you want a fast highway, you should have fewer cars. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>If there’s one thing humanity needs right now, it’s robots. Our oceans need cleaning up, our roads need maintenance, and many restaurants and farms can’t find enough staff. We technologists better get building the benevolent robot custodians that are ultimately going to make our lives better by filling potholes and picking up our trash.

You’ve likely been hearing this same robotics keynote at conferences, promising useful automata that will walk among us, for the last 20 years or so. So how come we don’t see them anywhere in our everyday lives?

Today’s podcast episode explores why the barrier to entry for developers in the robotics industry is steep and what can be done to change that. Our guest, Eliot Horowitz, CEO &amp; founder at Viam, shares his vision for a future in which it’s just as easy for developers to build robots as write code for a smart phone app.

      <itunes:summary>Not surprisingly, engineers stay about half as long at their companies as the average worker in other industries. The reason? The force is on our side as tech workers. Our skills are high in demand, and we’re compensated well for the brainpower that we bring to the table. Plus, tech is evolving so fast, you need to keep learning in new environments.

The thing is, there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it. Admittedly, it looks a little weird to be upgrading jobs every 3 months. But switching things up every year is understandable.

Being responsible for a P&amp;L, accountable to a board, and managing headcount? Before you stop reading, consider the case of our guest, Red Hat CEO Matt Hicks, who began as a developer, got his start tinkering in open source, and was ultimately driven by the unstoppable force of curiosity to take on roles as coach and chief officer.

Matt reflects on the highlights of his career journey, how he managed tradeoffs between his love for coding with his momentum through managerial ranks, and how his passion to be a mentor has been the driving force behind his progress.

Cassidy Williams, who recently joined the C-suite herself, helps to steer the conversation.

      <itunes:summary>Today’s streaming services have a vast content library, and a vastly different programming challenge than traditional television stations. Where linear TV tries to schedule content into time slots so the right demographics will see it and enjoy it, streaming services let you watch any content, any time you want. That means these service need to find a way to deliver the right content to every user, balancing what they will want with what will provide value over the long term. That’s where machine learning comes in.

On this sponsored episode of the podcast, Ben and Ryan talk with Shrikant Desai and Sowmya Subramanian, two engineering leaders at Warner Bros. Discovery who shape how their ML program figures out what your next favorite show might be. We cover the tools they’ve been using to build their learning pipelines, how a viewer’s history can shape their future, and whether ML algorithms can fill a human curator’s role to surprise and delight viewers. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Well, we don’t hate it per se. It’s more of a love/hate relationship, if we’re honest with ourselves. You can do it wrong: excessive top-down structure is the kryptonite of developer brilliance. Or you can do it right: setting up the team so everyone feels empowered and blameless accountability lets you evolve from mistakes and improve over time.

For today’s podcast episode, we sat down with two of our public platform teammates: Jon Chan, Director of Engineering, and Shanda Woods, Certified Scrum Professional extraordinaire, who also happens to be a yoga instructor and cycling coach. We discuss how to embrace Agile and Scrum as a creativity-driving mindset rather than a system of micromanagement.

      <itunes:summary>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we discuss how the days of traditional application monitoring are fading. Applications today are no longer a single program, but a network of services connected by API and RPC endpoints across cloud containers that are created and removed as needed. There’s more data coming from sources that may not persist for long. Diagnosing errors becomes harder, especially in a crisis.
We spoke with Martin Mao, CEO and co-founder of Chronosphere, about the increased difficulty in diagnosing errors in production, especially during a crisis. Complex systems create more data, and to paraphrase: more data, more problems. Chronosphere wants to do more than just give you observability into your problems; they want to help automate the response.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>When a company hits a period of hypergrowth, developers are in for a thrill ride. They need to start scaling their systems, moving to service architectures and clouds, and looking to solve problems others haven’t. But hypergrowth brings headaches, too, and chief among them is how to keep everyone aware of what’s going on with teams that they aren’t a part of.
When Spotify ran into this hypergrowth problem, they created Backstage, an open-source framework for building developer portals.

They need to start scaling their systems, moving to service architectures and clouds, and looking to solve problems others haven’t. But hypergrowth brings headaches, too, and chief among them is how to keep everyone aware of what’s going on with teams that they aren’t a part of.
When Spotify ran into this hypergrowth problem, they created Backstage, an open-source framework for building developer portals. Ben and Ryan talked with Helen Gruel and Tim Hansen about the genesis of the project, keeping docs with service information, and how Backstage’s plugin ecosystem keeps engineers from getting lost among dozens of tools.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:summary>We feel our best and do our best work when we can completely focus on what we’re doing and apply our full abilities to a task. That feeling is called the flow state, and it requires both a task worthy of your skills and the focus to apply them well. For software developers, accessing the flow state can be the difference between quality software and buggy code.
On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we chat with Marcel Twohig, Head of Design for the MX Series at Logitech, and Thomas Fritz, Associate Professor of Human Aspects of Software Engineering at the University of Zurich. This episode is the second in our four- part series presented by Logitech. We cover the research that Professor Fritz has done on flow states, the design work that Marcel and team have done to incorporate that research, and the tools that you can use to maximize your daily flow. </itunes:summary>

      <title>﻿The last technical interview you&apos;ll ever take</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Since the day a hiring manager first wheeled a whiteboard into a conference room, software engineers have dreaded the technical interview, which can be an all-day process (or multi-day homework assignment). If you’re interviewing for multiple roles, you can expect to write out a bubble sort in pseudocode for each one. These technical interviews do no favors for hiring companies, either, because the investment needed from both parties limits the number of candidates a company can consider. In this age of data-driven decisions, perhaps there’s a way that AI and ML can help candidates and companies find each other.  </p><p>On this episode of the podcast, sponsored by Turing AI, we chat with Chief Revenue Officer Prakash Gupta about building a better hiring process with AI. Turing helps companies scale their engineering programs quickly with remote developers from around the world. We talk about how to vet a profession without standard markers, the benefits of soft skills, and how AI-assisted hiring helps everyone involved. </p><p>While companies have been outsourcing development for years, COVID made the software industry almost entirely remote. Suddenly, every company has the ability to hire the best developers regardless of location. And good developers can find work at companies of all sizes without packing up and settling in Silicon Valley. </p><p>But when any company could conceivably interview any candidate, how do you vet candidates at scale? There is no standardized board certification for software engineers, after all. Every interviewer has to vet the candidates themselves, and that’s where human biases come in. </p><p>On one side, you have Fortune 500 companies developing complex systems and undergoing digital transformation projects, plus startups looking to scale their engineering organizations as their product finds market fit. On the other, you have a new generation of engineers trained on bootcamps and online resources who may not have opportunities where they live. That’s where Turing comes in, matching 1.7 million engineers from over 140 countries with jobs at hundreds of companies. </p><p>Turing strives to mitigate bias by collecting hundreds of signals about candidates over a four- to six-hour process. This process covers projects candidates have worked on, technology aptitude, and soft skills through 30-minute tests, candidates’ online presence in places like GitHub and Stack Overflow, and qualitative assessments refined over two years of feedback loops. </p><p>A process that once consisted of ten interviews can now drop to two or three at the most. Some Turing customers have eliminated interviews altogether, relying on Turing’s AI-powered solutions to surface and evaluate the best candidates.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><br /> </p><p>Ever since personal information started flowing into applications on the web, securing that information has become more and more important. General security and privacy frameworks like ISO-27001 and PCI provide guidance in securing systems. Now the law has gotten involved with the European Union’s GDPR and California’s CPRA. More laws are on the way, and these laws (and the frameworks) are changing as they meet legal challenges. With the legal landscape for privacy shifting so much, every engineer must ask: How do I keep my application in compliance?</p><p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we talk with Rob Picard and Matt Cooper of Vanta, who get that question every day. Their company makes security monitoring software that helps companies get into compliance quickly. We spoke about the shifting sands of privacy rules and regulations, tracking data flows through systems and across corporate borders, and how security automation can put up guardrails instead of gates. </p><p>Many security frameworks are undergoing modernization to reflect the way that distributed applications function today. And more countries and US states are passing their own privacy regulations. The privacy space is surprisingly dynamic, forcing companies to keep track of these frequent changes to stay current and compliant. Not everyone has in-house legal experts to follow the daily developments and communicate those to the engineering team. </p><p>For an engineering team just trying to understand the effort involved, it may be helpful to start figuring out where your data flows. Tracking it between internal services may be overkill; instead, track it across corporate boundaries, from one database, cloud provider, SaaS system, and dependency. Each of those should have their own data privacy agreement—plug into your procurement process to see what each piece of your stack promises on a privacy level. </p><p>Your DevOps and DevSecOps teams will probably want to automate much of the security engineering process as possible. Unfortunately, automating security is hard. The best path may not be to automate the defenses on your system; it might be better to instead automate the context that you provide to engineers. If someone wants to add a dependency, pop up a reminder that these dependencies can be fickle. Automate the boring stuff—context, reminders, to-dos—and let humans do the complex problem solving we’re so good at. </p><p>If you’re looking to add an in-house security expert as a service, check out <a href="https://www.vanta.com/">Vanta.com</a>.

      <title>Run your microservices in no-fail mode</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://temporal.io/">Temporal Technologies</a> is a scalable open-source platform for developers to build and run reliable cloud applications.</p><p>ICYMI, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/11/23/the-macro-problem-with-microservices/">here’s a post</a> we wrote with Ryland Goldstein, Head of Product at Temporal, discussing how software engineering has shifted from a monolithic to a microservices model—thereby introducing a whole new set of challenges for software engineers.</p><p>Maxim, who grew up in Russia, is renowned in the microservices world. He spent decades architecting mission-critical systems at MSFT, Amazon, and Uber, where he designed <a href="https://github.com/uber/cadence">Cadence</a> and spun it out into Temporal.

      <title>Talking blockchain, functional programming, and the future with Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman﻿﻿</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>While blockchains are huge right now, finding one to build on that doesn’t use a ton of energy, has good privacy protections, and operates efficiently is harder than it looks. The original breakout blockchain, Bitcoin, was slow to adopt any innovations coming out of research. Other blockchains use the electricity of a small country to play elaborate gambling games. For someone looking to build the future of Web3, what are your options?</p><p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we talk to Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman. After finding out that the Bitcoin blockchain wouldn’t incorporate all the good ideas generated around it—proof of stake, privacy improvements, and smart contracts to name a few—he decided to build his own. </p><p>Arthur has a background in machine learning and statistics but spent his early 20s teaching self-driving cars how to turn left and working in quantitative finance for high-frequency trading. High-frequency trading was data-driven, but there was so much noise that machine learning didn’t do very well. Self-driving cars, meanwhile, presented a more structured problem, so neural networks could yield good results. </p><p>Around that time, Arthur got bit by the crypto bug. It lived at the intersection of a lot of his interests: Cryptography touched on computer science and math, but his time in finance got him wondering about banks and money work. The idea of individual sovereignty scratched a personal philosophical itch. </p><p>Naturally, Arthur decided to try some mining software. It took all of his computer’s resources, so he uninstalled it. But after seeing the price of Bitcoin break a dollar and other news items about it, he looked closer. He started to think about what a company could do if it didn’t have to maintain banking relationships. He thought about possible applications, like decentralized poker. </p><p>When Bitcoin refused to adopt the improvements developed by competing alt coins, Arthur started thinking about a new blockchain that would respond to new developments and focus on efficient processing, security, and a good smart contract system. Forking the code wasn’t enough; he needed a new ledger. </p><p>That’s when Tezos was born. It was initially built by a small team of OCaml programmers using that language’s functional subset. Arthur was inspired by the example of WhatsApp, which was built by a small team of senior Erlang engineers. While OCaml would limit the talent he could hire, it would be a very efficient way to build an error-free transaction system. He could have built the whole thing in Java, sure, but Arthur estimates that it would have cost a whole lot more. </p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about what an engineer’s blockchain ecosystem looks like, check out the Tezos home page.

      <title>Building out a managed Kubernetes service is a bigger job than you think</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>You may be running your code in containers. You might even have taken the plunge and orchestrated it all with YAML code through Kubernetes. But infrastructure as code becomes a whole new level of complicated when setting up a managed Kubernetes service. </p><p>On this sponsored episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, Ben and Ryan talk with David Dymko and Walt Ribeiro of Vultr about what they went through to build their managed Kubernetes service as a cloud offering. It was a journey that ended not just with a managed K8s service, but also with a wealth of additional tooling, upgrades, and open sourcing. </p><p>When building out a Kubernetes implementation, you can abstract away some of the complexity, especially if you use some of the more popular tools like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/">Kubeadm</a> or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubespray/">Kubespray</a>. But when using a managed service, you want to be able to focus on your workloads and only your workloads, which means taking away the control plane. The user doesn’t need to care about the underlying infrastructure, but for those designing it, the missing control plane opens a whole heap of trouble. </p><p>Once you remove this abstraction, your cloud cluster is treated as a single solid compute. But then how do you do upgrades? How do you maintain x509 certifications for HTTPS calls? How do you get metrics? Without the control plane, Vultr needed to communicate to their Kubernetes worker nodes through the API. And wouldn’t you know it: the API isn’t all that well-documented. </p><p>They took it back to bare necessities, the MVP feature set of their K8s cloud service. They’d need the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/">Cloud Controller Manager (CCM)</a> and the <a href="https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/">Container Storage Interface (CSI)</a> as core components to have Vultr be a first-class citizen on a Kubernetes cluster. They built a Go client to interface using those components and figured, hey, why not open-source this? That led to a few other open-source projects, like a Terraform integration and a command-line interface. </p><p>This was the start of a two-year journey connecting all the dots that this project required. They needed a managed load balancer that could work without the control plane or any of the tools that interfaced with it. They built it. They needed a quality-of-life update to their API to catch up with everything that today’s developer expects: modern CRUD actions, REST best practices, and pagination. All the while, they kept listening to their customers to make sure they didn’t stray too far from the original product. </p><p>To see the results of their journey, listen to the podcast and check out <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultr.com</a> for all of their cloud offerings, available in 25 locations worldwide.</p>

      <title>Getting through a SOC 2 audit with your nerves intact</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Once a company reaches a certain size, their customers might start asking for proof that it has good security and data habits. They want to know if there’s a business continuity plan in place in case disaster strikes. For many companies, formalizing this proof means submitting to an auditing process known as SOC 2. If you’re a developer at one of these companies, particularly if you provide or use SaaS applications, you’ll end up having to implement the controls these audits require. </p><p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, Ben and Ryan talk with James Ciesielski, CTO and co-founder, and Megan Dean, information security and risk compliance manager, both of Rewind. We talk about how you can prep for and successfully get through a SOC 2 audit, how <a href="https://rewind.com/">backing up your SaaS data</a> can provide business continuity, and the benefits of establishing a relationship with your auditor. </p><p>A SOC 2 report shows your customers the level of security controls that you have in place. It’s based on the auditing standards set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. You tell them what controls you have in place and they verify it. Once a company starts attracting enterprise-level customers, a SOC 2 becomes a must-have. </p><p>Companies perform SOC 2 audits using a variety of tools: sometimes it’s purpose-built SaaS tools; sometimes it’s a cascade of spreadsheets. Ultimately, what’s important is providing an audit trail for your controls, a record that proves that your security does what you claim it does. Trust, but verify. </p><p>The process can grow complicated, as companies can have 100 to as many as 300 SaaS applications running in their business. That’s a lot of important business data on someone else’s cloud. Many of these SaaS applications operate data on the shared responsibility model: they ensure the service is available and secure, and you ensure that your data is accurate and secure. </p><p>A key part of these security controls is disaster recovery and business continuity. Imagine that you’re using a SaaS application to track your audit process. What happens if a disgruntled employee wrecks your data, or your cat walks over your keyboard, hitting just the right combination of keys to delete something important? Or what if you unwittingly get flagged on a T&C violation and get deplatformed? Your audit trail could be lost if you haven’t upheld your end of the shared responsibility model and backed up your data. </p><p>Ultimately, having experts who know the process can help. Your auditor, too, can be a resource, so get to know them. They want you to succeed. They want to help you improve your audit process because it makes their lives easier.</p>

      <title>Column by your name: The analytics database that skips the rows</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>These days, every company looking at analyzing their data for insights has a data pipeline setup. Many companies have a fast production database, often a NoSQL or key-value store, that goes through a data pipeline.The pipeline process performs some sort of extract-transform-load process on it, then routes it to a larger data store that the analytics tools can access. But what if you could skip some steps and speed up the process with a database purpose-built for analytics?</p><p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we chat with Rohit (Ro) Amarnath, the CTO at <a href="https://www.vertica.com/">Vertica</a>, to find out how your analytics engine can speed up your workflow. After a humble beginning with a ZX Spectrum 128, he’s now in charge of Vertica Accelerator, a SaaS version of the Vertica database. </p><p>Vertica was founded by database researcher Dr. Michael Stonebreaker and Andrew Palmer. Dr. Stonebreaker helped develop several databases, including Postgres, Streambase, and VoltDB. Vertica was born out of research into purpose-built databases. Stonebreaker’s <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/user/1547">research</a> found that columnar database storage was faster for data warehouses because there were fewer read/writes per request. </p><p>Here’s a quick example that shows how columnar databases work. Suppose that you want all the records from a specific US state or territory. There are 52 possible values here (depending on how you count territories). To find all instances of a single state in a row-based DB, the search must check every row for the value of the state column. However, searching by column is faster by an order of magnitude: it just runs down the column to find matching values, then retrieves row data for the matches. </p><p>The Vertica database was designed specifically for analytics as opposed to transactional databases. Ro spent some time at a Wall Street firm building reports—P&L, performance, profitability, etc. Transactions were important to day-to-day operations, but the real value of data came from analyses that showed where to cut costs or increase investments in a particular business. Analytics help with overall strategy, which tends to be more far-reaching and effective. </p><p>For most of its life, Vertica has been an on-premises database managing a data warehouse. But with the ease of cloud storage, Vertica Accelerator is looking to give you a data lake as a service. If you’re unfamiliar, data lakes take the data warehouse concept—central storage for all your data—and remove limits. You can have “rivers” of data flowing into your stores; if you go from a terabyte to a petabyte overnight, your cloud provider will handle it for you. </p><p>Vertica has worked with plenty of industries that push massive amounts of data: healthcare, aviation, online games. They’ve built a lot of functionality into the database itself to speed up all manner of applications. One of their prospective customers had a machine learning model with thousands of lines of code that was reduced to about ten lines because so much was being done in the database itself. </p><p>In the future, Vertica plans to offer more powerful management of data warehouses and lakes, including handling the metadata that comes with them.

      <title>A collaborative hub for infrastructure as code</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we talk with Marcin Wyszynski, founder and CEO at <a href="https://spacelift.io/">Spacelift</a>. Marcin says Spacelift aims to be for infrastructure-as-code what GitHub is to git. It centralizes everything about your IaC system: it runs code, deploys within CI/CD pipelines, tracks the progress of your infrastructure, and gives you insight into who made what changes and why. Today it works with the IaC tools already out there: Terraform, Cloud Formation, and Pulumi, with plans to add support for services like Ansible and Kubernetes in the future. </p><p>Like a lot of programmers, Marcin got into coding through games. Once he ran through the limited number of Commodore 64 games at his local shop in Poland, he learned to program his own. But he never thought of programming as a career, so when it came time to pick a college major, he followed a group of his peers into sociology. Sociology, with its heavy focus on statistics, brought him back to programming. </p><p>He landed his first job at Google reviewing copy for Ads, which lasted until he could automate himself out of it. Google gave him increasingly technical roles until he moved into an SRE position handling tape backups, a job that is mostly very boring until it becomes extremely exciting. After that, it was a stint at Facebook spinning up point-of-presence clusters around the world, then CTO at a startup that didn’t catch on as he’d hoped. </p><p>With this wealth of experience under his belt, he went into consulting. As a consultant, he had his bag of best practices, open-source tools, processes, and scripts that he brought with him, but he also built bespoke pieces of technology for every single one of his clients. One need his clients had in common was a way to manage the code that defined their infrastructure. </p><p>During Marcin’s career, there were many times when he built the thing he needed: games, automation, scripts. When his consulting clients would leave for a new organization, they would reach out to ask if he could provide them with the solution he had built for infrastructure as code. Realizing that he had created something which addressed a pain point common to many companies, he decided to turn this solution into a new company: Spacelift. </p><p>Spacelift aims to take the heavy lifting out of infrastructure-as-code, automate it, and make it auditable. When a change gets made, everyone can see it and comment on it. From the product manager to the junior dev, everyone knows what’s going on, even if an infrastructure change doesn’t fit the original architecture docs. Plus, the SRE team no longer need to go on archeological expeditions to find a database secretly running and costing the company five figures a month. </p><p>To learn more about Spacelift, check out their website at <a href="https://spacelift.io/">https://spacelift.io/</a>, where you can start a free trial and see it in action. </p>

      <title>Making Agile work for data science</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Data scientists and engineers don’t always play well together. Data scientists will plan out a solution, carefully build models, test them in notebooks, then throw that solution over the wall to engineering. Implementing that solution can take months.</p><p>Historically, the data science team has been purely science-driven. Work on methodologies, prove out something that they wanted to achieve, and then hand it over to the engineering organization. That could take many months.</p><p>Over the past three to five years, they’ve been moving their engineering and data science operations onto the cloud as part of an overall Agile transformation and a move from being sales-led to being product-led. With most of their solutions migrated over, they decided that along with modernizing their infrastructure, they wanted to modernize their legacy systems, add new functions and scientific techniques, and take advantage of new technologies to scale and meet the demand coming their way. </p><p>While all of the rituals and the rigor of Agile didn't always facilitate the more open-ended nature of the data science work at 84.51°, having both data science and engineering operating in a similar tech stack has been a breath of fresh air. Working cross-functionally has shortened the implementation delay. At the same time, being closer to the engineering side of the house has given the data science team a better sense of how to fit their work into the pipeline. </p><p>Getting everyone on the same tech stack had a side effect. Between the increasing complexity of the projects, geographic diversity of the folks on these projects, a rise in remote work, and continued growth, locating experts became harder. But with everyone working in the same tech, more people could answer questions and become SMEs. </p><p>Of course, we’d be remiss if we didn’t tell you that 84.51° was asking and answering questions on Stack Overflow for Teams. It was helpful when Chris and Michael no longer had to call on the SMEs they knew by name but could suddenly draw more experts out of the woodwork by asking a question. Check out this episode for insights on data science, agile, and building a great knowledge base for a large, increasingly distributed engineering org.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Today’s episode is bookended by two questions about professional or academic ethics. Ben, Ryan, and Cassidy start by discussing a question on the Workplace Stack Exchange about whether to use open-source projects as dependencies for work projects. TL;DR: If you want to own the code you write outside work, get that in writing when you take the job.

Our second query is a question on Academia Stack Exchange from a student who’s wondering if they cheated because they found the solution to an exam question in the course of studying. In between: Jack Dorsey resigns, the problem with phantom braking, and the time Cassidy almost won a car.</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Maxwell, a solution architect at xMatters, took a winding road to get to where he is.

It was a lateral move within his company, which was migrating an on-prem solution into the cloud. It’s a journey that plenty of companies are making now: breaking an application into microservices, running processes in containers, and using Kubernetes to orchestrate the whole thing. Non-production environments would go down and waste SRE time, making it harder to address problems in the production pipeline. </p><p>At the heart of their issues was the incident response process. They had several bottlenecks that prevented them from delivering value to their customers quickly. Incidents would send emails to the relevant engineers, sometimes 20 on a single email, which made it easy for any one engineer to ignore the problem—someone else has got this. They had a bad silo problem, where escalating to the right person across groups became an issue of its own. And of course, most of this was manual. Their MTTR—mean time to resolve—was lagging. </p><p>Maxwell moved over to xMatters because they managed to solve these problems through clever automation. Their product automates the scheduling and notification process so that the right person knows about the incident as soon as possible. At the core of this process was a different MTTR—mean time to respond. Once an engineer started working to resolve a problem, it was all down to runbooks and skill. But the lag between the initial incident and that start was the real slowdown. </p><p>It’s not just the response from the first SRE on call. It’s the other escalations down the line—to data engineers, for example—that can eat away time. They’ve worked hard to make  escalation configuration easy. It not only handles who's responsible for specific services and metrics, but who’s in the escalation chain from there. When the incident hits, the notifications go out through a series of configured channels; maybe it tries a chat program first, then email, then SMS. </p><p>The on-call process is often a source of dread, but automating the escalation process can take some of the sting out of it. Check out the episode to learn more. </p>

But the lag between the initial incident and that start was the real slowdown. </p><p>It’s not just the response from the first SRE on call. It’s the other escalations down the line—to data engineers, for example—that can eat away time. They’ve worked hard to make  escalation configuration easy. It not only handles who's responsible for specific services and metrics, but who’s in the escalation chain from there. When the incident hits, the notifications go out through a series of configured channels; maybe it tries a chat program first, then email, then SMS. </p><p>The on-call process is often a source of dread, but automating the escalation process can take some of the sting out of it. Check out the episode to learn more. </p>

      <itunes:summary>If your organization is running code on a production server 24/7, you’re going to need a process to handle when that code—or the infrastructure it runs on—fails. No code is bug free, so failures will happen. That means that your SREs and developers are going to have to spend some time on call and ready to respond to when the application breaks down. On this sponsored episode of the podcast, we talk to Eric Maxwell, a solution architect at xMatters, about automating, intelligent escalation chains.</itunes:summary>

      <title>A murder mystery: who killed our user experience?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The infrastructure that networked applications lives on is getting more and more complicated. There was a time when you could serve an application from a single machine on premises. But now, with cloud computing offering painless scaling to meet your demand, your infrastructure becomes abstracted and not really something you have contact with directly. Compound that problem with with architecture spread across dozens, even hundreds of microservices, replicated across multiple data centers in an ever changing cloud, and tracking down the source of system failures becomes something like a murder mystery. Who shot our uptime in the foot? </p><p>A good observability system helps with that. On this sponsored episode of the Stack Overflow Podcast, we talk with Greg Leffler of Splunk about the keys to instrumenting an observable system and how the OpenTelemetry standard makes observability easier, even if you aren’t using Splunk’s product. </p><p>Observability is really an outgrowth of traditional monitoring. You expect that some service or system could break, so you keep an eye on it. But observability applies that monitoring to an entire system and gives you the ability to answer the unexpected questions that come up. It uses three principal ways of viewing system data: logs, traces, and metrics.</p><p>Metrics are a number and a timestamp that tell you particular details. Traces follow a request through a system. And logs are the causes and effects recorded from a system in motion. Splunk wants to add a fourth one—events—that would track specific user events and browser failures. </p><p>Observing all that data first means you have to be able to track and extract that data by instrumenting your system to produce it. Greg and his colleagues at Splunk are huge fans of OpenTelemetry. It’s an open standard that can extract data for any observability platform. You instrument your application once and never have to worry about it again, even if you need to change your observability platform. </p><p>Why use an approach that makes it easy for a client to switch vendors? Leffler and Splunk argue that it’s not only better for customers, but for Splunk and the observability industry as a whole. If you’ve instrumented your system with a vendor locked solution, then you may not switch, you may just let your observability program fall by the wayside. That helps exactly no one. </p><p>As we’ve seen, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/09/02/pandemic-lockdowns-accelerated-cloud-migration-by-three-to-four-years/">people are moving to the cloud</a> at an ever faster pace. That’s no surprise; it offers automatic scaling for arbitrary traffic volumes, high availability, and worry-free infrastructure failure recovery. But moving to the cloud can be expensive, and you have to do some work with your application to be able to see everything that’s going on inside it. Plenty of people just throw everything into the cloud and let the provider handle it, which is fine until they see the bill.</p><p>Observability based on an open standard makes it easier for everyone to build a more efficient and robust service in the cloud. Give the episode a listen and let us know what you think in the comments.</p>

      <title>This AI-assisted bug bash is offering serious prizes for squashing nasty code</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>While every developer loves a good story about discovering and fixing a gnarly bug, not everyone enjoys the work of finding those bugs. Most folks would prefer to be writing business logic and solving new problems. But those input validation errors and resource leaks won’t solve themselves. </p><p>Or will they?</p><p>AWS Bug Bust is a global competition launched with the goal of finding and fixing one million bugs in codebases around the world. It takes the traditional bug bash and turns it into a competition that anyone can enter. Got a repo or two that you’ve been meaning to clean up? Enter the Bug Bust and start squashing. </p><p>This competition awards points to organizations, as well as individuals within an organization, for every bug that they fix in their own repos. A little friendly competition can motivate developers to fix more bugs in order to move up the leaderboards. How do you think we built Stack Overflow? Fake internet points are very important around here. With the Bug Bust competition, it’s not just fake internet points and personal glory; top bug squashers—overall and within top organizations—can win all expense paid trips to <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">re:Invent 2021</a>. </p><p>In a traditional bug bust, someone has to find the bugs, file tickets on all of them, then collect them for squashing. In the Bug Bust, Amazon has managed to automate that part of the process. That’s because the Bug Bust is built on their AI-powered code review and profiling tool, CodeGuru. </p><p>CodeGuru uses static analysis and machine learning with some additional automated reasoning to find bugs in code; everything from best practices to concurrency issues, resource leaks, security problems, and more. AI isn’t here to take your jobs, it’s here to automated away the tedious stuff. Developers get to harness the power of artificial intelligence in their everyday lives.</p><p>Concurrency and resource leak issues tend to drain the soul out of the developers. You could spend all day trying to optimize and close those. CodeGuru includes a function profiler that looks for a codebase’s most expensive calls. It’s a lightweight agent actively running and looking for ways to reduce the cost of the running application. </p><p>These bugs, along with security issues and AWS API calls, are the ones that earn the most points. But all bugs earn their bashers points; CodeGuru spots code inefficiencies, duplications, and general code quality detectors, and performs input validation. The model behind this is pretrained on years of Amazon bug hunting experience. The system does learn from you as to what is a good bug in your codebase, but it’s not training on your code. It’s your feedback that makes CodeGuru a better bug hunter.</p><p>If you have Java and Python code in a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket, or AWS CodeCommit repository, you can jump into the competition. Sign up with your email and you get 30 days to run as many Bug Busts as you want for free. The top ten individual bug busters get VIP treatment at the 2021 re:Invent conference (and an all-expense-paid trip there), which is being held in person this year. Top participating organizations get  a ticket to give to one of their developers as well. For those bashers outside of the top ten, you can still earn some sweet swag by passing some point milestones. </p><p>The contest to win the trip to re:Invent 2021 runs through September, but you can still automate your bug bashes and get swag anytime. Want to get started? Head over to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bugbust/">AWS Bug Bust site now</a>.</p>

Pretty good for 1980. </p><p>Weaveworks based their project on <a href="https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/">Flux</a>, an open source engine.

Pretty good for 1980. </p><p>Weaveworks based their project on <a href="https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/">Flux</a>, an open source engine. If you're not a big corporation and you want to use it, it's free!</p><p>Before there was Kubernetes, Google created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(cluster_manager)">Borg</a>, an internal cluster manager. It has yet to be assimilated by Kubernetes. </p><p>Ben thinks that, if it gets too easy to manage Kubernetes clusters, we'll be out of a job talking about the pain of cluster manages. </p><p>Today's lifeboat badge goes to Daniel Ribeiro for the answer to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44263450/how-can-i-run-go-binary-files/44278127#44278127">How can I run Go binary files?</a></p>

      <title>From search trees to neural nets, a deep dive into natural language processing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We chatted with three guests:</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/migueljette/?originalSubdomain=ca">Miguel Jetté</a>: Head of AI R&D</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdongian/">Josh Dong</a>: AI Engineering Manager</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-drexler/">Jenny Drexler</a>: Senior Speech Scientist</p><p>When Jette was studying mathematics in the early 2000s, his focus was on computational biology, and more specifically, phylogenetic trees, and DNA sequences. He wanted to understand the evolution of certain traits and the forces that explain why our bones are a certain length or our brains a certain size. As it turned out, the algorithms and techniques he learned in this field mapped very well to the emerging discipline of automatic speech recognition, or ASR. </p><p>During this period, Montreal was emerging as a hotbed for artificial intelligence, and Jette found himself working for Nuance, the company behind the original implementation of Siri. That experience led him to several positions in the world of speech recognition, and he eventually landed at Rev, where he founded the company’s AI department. </p><p>Jette describes Rev as an “Uber for Transcription.” Anyone can sign up for the platform and earn money by listening to audio submitted by clients and transcribing the speech into text. This means the company has a tremendous dataset of raw audio that has been annotated by human beings and, in many cases, assessed a second time by the client. For someone looking to build an AI system that mastered the domain of speech to text, this was a goldmine. </p><p>Jette built the earliest version of Rev’s AI, but it was up to our second guest, Josh Dong, to productize and scale that system. He helped the department transition from older technologies like Perl to more popular languages like Python. He also focused on practical concerns like modularity and reusable components. To combine machine learning and DevOps, Dong added Docker containers and a testing pipeline. If you’re interested in the nuts and bolts of keeping a system like Rev’s running at tremendous scale, you’ll want to check out this part of the show. </p><p>We also explore some of the fascinating future and promise this technology holds in our time with Jenny Drexler. She explains how Rev is moving from a hybrid model—one that combines Jette’s older statistical techniques with Dong’s newer machine learning approach—to a new system that will be ML from end-to-end. This will open up the door for powerful applications, like a single system that can convert speech text across multiple languages in a single piece of audio. </p><p>“One of the things that's really cool about these end to end models is that basically, whatever data you have, it can learn to handle it. So a very similar architecture can do sequence to sequence learning with different kinds of sequences. The model architecture that you might use for speech recognition can actually look very similar to what you might use for translation. And you can use that same architecture, to say, feed in audio in lots of different languages and be able to do transcription for any of them within one model. It's much harder with the hybrid models to sort of put all the right pieces together to make that happen,” explains Drexler.</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about the past, present, and future of artificial intelligence that can understand our spoken language and learn how to respond, check out the full episode.

As Cassidy explained:</p><p>“Based on technology from FeaturePeek, Deploy Previews enables reviewers to comment, screen record, and annotate right from the actual preview link. No new tabs. No new tools.

Now folks from marketing and design can offer feedback and be more tightly involved in the development process for new features, products, and websites.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>To start things off, we talk about the launch of Articles, a new content type for Stack Overflow Teams that lets you write longer, subjective pieces. Sometimes it's best to share knowledge through Q&A, but other times you've got complicated, narrative, DevOps recipes or a policy paper and FAQ. Now your knowledge artifacts can all live in one place. <br /><br />"The FAQ is the great folk form of the internet" - quotable moments featuring Paul Ford.<br /><br />If you're interested in another cut at this old saw, <a href="http://mailchimp.com/developer" target="_blank">Mailchimp.com/developer</a> is Postlight's take on what developer docs should look like. Sara is convinced it's all about the left nav.<br /><br />Speaking of convictions, a conflict is tearing Sara's home apart. Ben and Paul step in to save her marriage. The question at hand: should managers of developers EVER make technical decisions?<br /><br />Finally, Paul talks about his experience using Google Cloud Run to build a fun little tool called <a href="https://ephemeralist-ixz4p7lmaq-ue.a.run.app/">Ephemeralist</a>. It pulls in random images from public domain collections hosted by museums and archives. Use it to take a break from the negativity of social media or the news.

Think of the kind of overlays and interactivity that you see with most flat screen TVs today. Back in 1995, this was brand new territory.

Originally conceived as an operating system for interactive set-top boxes, Java is now active on more than 45 billion virtual machines around the globe. From computers to cars, from Minecraft to the Mars Rover, its reach is astonishing. We dig into the history of why it was developed and what allowed it to flourish to such a degree.</itunes:summary>

A self-taught programmer, Alex was working full time a few years back, but feeling frustrated that he wasn&apos;t using or learning modern web languages like Javascript or React. He kept promising himself he would learn on his off-time, but failing to follow through. Finally, he came up with a system to hold himself accountable. That idea, a public promise under the hashtag #100DaysOfCode, has become a movement and a community, with thousands of other coders joining in to pledge their commitment to self-directed learning. </itunes:summary>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week on the pod, we chat about <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ladies-and-gentlemen-cloudflare-tv/">Cloudflare.tv</a>, a 24/7 streaming channel dedicated to discussions of software, startups, and technology. </p><p>We also dig into a new offering called <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">Github Classroom</a>. Do pedagogy and programming mix well? Can this approach to collaborative work be useful beyond the computer science classroom?</p><p>So, you want to delete half your database? Well, I can guarantee <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8890966/want-to-delete-half-of-the-records-from-mysql-database-table/8891023#8891023">this method </a>will delete <i>about</i> half your database...<i>most</i> of the time. Thanks, as always, to our Lifeboat badge winner of the week!</p>

He finalyl sat down and did some parsing.  He is ready for you to make fun of him.</p>

      <title>The Great COBOL Crunch</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, New Jersey Governer Phil Murphy announced that the state desperately needed the help of <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/04/new-jersey-unemployment-cobol-coronavirus.html">COBOL programmers</a>. The 60-year-old programming language runs the state's unemployment system, and crashed under the historic influx of applications created by the COVID-19 crisis. So, if you're a COBOL programmer listening to this show or know a retired COBOL ace who wants to lend a hand, you can help get folks access to the funds they desperately need. </p><p>In the second half of the episode, we talk about Ben's many trips to CES over the years a journalist. This annual pilgrimage got him added to lots of email lists from manufacturers and suppliers of electronic components. In the last few weeks, the emails have suddenly shifted: instead of offering widgets and wires, they are pitching the ability to make and deliver critical medical supplies. We dig into the ways in which technology, hardware, and manufacturing have changed over the last few decades and the ripple effects that massive global transformation is having today. </p><p> </p>

This annual pilgrimage got him added to lots of email lists from manufacturers and suppliers of electronic components. In the last few weeks, the emails have suddenly shifted: instead of offering widgets and wires, they are pitching the ability to make and deliver critical medical supplies. We dig into the ways in which technology, hardware, and manufacturing have changed over the last few decades and the ripple effects that massive global transformation is having today. </p><p> </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Echeruo's new venture is called <a href="https://loveandmagic.company/">Love and Magic</a>, a startup studio that helps companies of all sizes maximize their ability to innovate. </p><p>For anyone that has an idea they have been hoping to turn into a startup, Echeruo and his collaborators just introduced the <a href="https://www.startupschoolofalchemy.com/courses/practical-steps-to-transform-your-idea-into-a-startup">Startup School of Alchemy</a>. It's being taught at WeWork and Princeton University. It offers a six-week curriculum designed to help aspiring entrepreneurs find product-market fit.Apply with the code "stackoverflow" and you get $1000 off the course, a 40% discount.</p><p>Echeruo says his time working in finance and with Microsoft Excel was what gave him the ability to think of how data from maps could be optimized by an algorithm and built into a useful mobile app. </p><p>For those who don't know, our co-founder and Chairmam, Joel Spolsky, was part of the team at Microsoft that built Excel. Here is legendary 2015 talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nbkaYsR94c">You Suck at Excel</a>, where he organizes a spreadsheet to keep track of what he pays his Pokemon, ahem,I mean, uh, employees. <br /><br />You can take a deeper dive into the backstory of how Chinedu built HopStop below, related in his own words.</p><p><i>I've always had difficulty with directions. When I grew up in Nigeria, I remember getting lost in my own house. It wasn’t like it was a mansion, it was a four-bedroom house. </i></p><p><i>So you can imagine how I felt when I got to NYC and had to get around with the subway and bus system! I remember walking up once to one of those blown up maps in the subway station. My nose was a feet away from the dust laden map. The subway lines looked like tangled noodles. Complexity galore! </i></p><p><i>New Yorkers used to walk around with these pocket guides—Hagstrom maps. I was going on a date in the Lower East Side. It doesn’t have the grid like the rest of the city. I got lost and was very late getting to the bar.I can't remember how, the date went but I remember what I did first thing next morning. I walked over to the subway station, grabbed a subway MAP and laid it on the floor and tried to figure it out. There’s driving directions. But there weren’t subway directions. So I was solving my own problems. </i></p><p><i>I was looking for the complete directions—leave your house, turn left, go into this particular entrance, get on this train, get off at this station, use this exit. Because I was, in a lot of ways, the ultimate user, we ended up building a product that solved the complete problem—get me from where I am now to where I need to be. </i></p><p><i>I was non-technical, I worked for a hedge fund. I may have been thinking algorithmically, I knew that this was computationally possible. But I didn’t know how to make it a reality. In conceiving the problem, I threw all the data into spreadsheets. I interned at this company when I was in college, where I learned about spreadsheets. I found the work very tedious, but I learned how to think about data, to think in tables. It allowed me to conceptualize complexity. </i></p><p><i>To conceptualize the first subway data as a spreadsheet, I started by staring at the subway map laid on the wood floor of my apartment. The most obvious features were colors, lines, and stops. So those are the tables I typed into Excel first. Then I realized the lines also represented two train directions so I redid the spreadsheet. Then I realized the stops served multiple subway lines, so I redid the spreadsheet. Then I realized some of the stops would only be active during certain periods, so I redid the spreadsheet. We kept on learning and adjusting. It took us a long time before we had a data model that robustly described NYC's subway system. We even figured out how to automatically account for the frequent weekend NYC subway diversions.</i></p><p><i>To build the first version of the app, I went to eLance, described to these computer scientists the data set in Excel, routes, stops, exits, entrances, and I sent it in. This developer in Siberia, Russia, emailed me, came up with a solution. But he turned out to be a complete genius, he built the core of the first version of Hopstop. Here I was, a Nigerian, sitting in my apartment using messenger, email, on a laptop. And I never met Alex for four years. We built Hopstop over four years without ever meeting each other.</i></p><p><i>We ran very lean. Alex did all the coding. I did the subway data and user experience. I'd have to ride to different subway stations to note each subway entrance and exit, etc. When we added the bus system, Rajeev and his data team in India helped input the bus stops and schedules. And four years later, we were purchased by Apple, so quite the ride.</i></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Software is eating the world, but what's on the menu for dessert?</p><p>This week we chat about the best way for engineers to give feedback to executives. Paul explains the Purple room method they use at Postlight. Sara references <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296"><i>Zero to One</i></a> and why engineers and marketers have so much trouble communicating.</p><p>As a member of a marketing department , it's true our job is to see the glass as half full. But sometimes the point of the exercise is to be aspirational. Police <a href="https://opus.uleth.ca/bitstream/handle/10133/1150/Fuller_Merle_E.pdf">learn how to be suspicious</a>, marketers learn how to sell, and engineers look for what's broken so they can fix it.</p><p>We chat about the ten thousand or so parking meters that <a href="https://www.govtech.com/transportation/Software-Glitch-Stops-Credit-Card-Use-in-NYC-Parking-Meters.html">went on the fritz</a> in New York City. The company says it was the result of a fraud prevention protocol. Was this a Y2K style glitch or a logic bomb?</p><p>Sara finds the developer angle on the recent rift in the British Royal Family. New technologies always reshape the Monarchy's relationship to the public. From the first radio address to the televised coronation, to <a href="https://sussexroyal.com/funding/">a Wordpress website</a> and an Instagram post, each generation tries to use the modern medium to their advantage.</p><p>We discuss a fairly devious bit of brilliant parenting. If your young child wants to be a YouTube star, and you can build them their own private version of the platform, with randomly generated likes and none of the cyber-bullying, are you protecting them? Or, perhaps, crafting a Truman Show for the internet age that will have consequences down the road.</p><p>Last but not least, we check out the Blazor tag, one of the fastest growing areas of interest on Stack Overflow. It's a framework that extends the established Razor syntax. The goal is to enable developers to write client-side code in .NET, backed by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webassembly">WebAssembly</a>.</p>

Sara references <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296"><i>Zero to One</i></a> and why engineers and marketers have so much trouble communicating.</p><p>As a member of a marketing department , it's true our job is to see the glass as half full. But sometimes the point of the exercise is to be aspirational. Police <a href="https://opus.uleth.ca/bitstream/handle/10133/1150/Fuller_Merle_E.pdf">learn how to be suspicious</a>, marketers learn how to sell, and engineers look for what's broken so they can fix it.</p><p>We chat about the ten thousand or so parking meters that <a href="https://www.govtech.com/transportation/Software-Glitch-Stops-Credit-Card-Use-in-NYC-Parking-Meters.html">went on the fritz</a> in New York City. The company says it was the result of a fraud prevention protocol. Was this a Y2K style glitch or a logic bomb?</p><p>Sara finds the developer angle on the recent rift in the British Royal Family. New technologies always reshape the Monarchy's relationship to the public. From the first radio address to the televised coronation, to <a href="https://sussexroyal.com/funding/">a Wordpress website</a> and an Instagram post, each generation tries to use the modern medium to their advantage.</p><p>We discuss a fairly devious bit of brilliant parenting. If your young child wants to be a YouTube star, and you can build them their own private version of the platform, with randomly generated likes and none of the cyber-bullying, are you protecting them? Or, perhaps, crafting a Truman Show for the internet age that will have consequences down the road.</p><p>Last but not least, we check out the Blazor tag, one of the fastest growing areas of interest on Stack Overflow. It's a framework that extends the established Razor syntax. The goal is to enable developers to write client-side code in .NET, backed by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webassembly">WebAssembly</a>.</p>

      <title>How Would You React?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p> </p><h2>Part 1</h2><p>The crew chats about how Paul and Sara made the transition from individual contributors to managers overseeing teams of engineers. Sara used to see this transition as a form of selling out, but has a new perspective after having made the shift. Paul admits he still doesn’t feel like a “CEO” and how he approaches his role as the co-founder who focuses on creating signal instead of operations. OF course, we argue about Bitcoin, and finally we examine the role luck plays in life, especially for The Rock. </p><h2>Interview - Kent C Dodds</h2><p><a href="https://kentcdodds.com/about/">Kent</a> admits that when he first tried programming, he just couldn’t understand strings, and decided the career path wasn’t for him. He ended up on a track that would have made him an accountant or business intelligence analyst. From that perch, however, he began to find ways to automate and improve his workflows. Not only did this help him stand out at work, it reawakened his interest in coding, which is now his full time career. </p><h2>Part 2 </h2><p>Sara talks about the difference between writing code for software applications, and writing firmware, which she got into while helping to launch and run <a href="https://jewelbots.com/">Jewelbots</a>. Paul and Sara recall what it was like working in tech during the 90s, when they had to constantly worry about how to conserve RAM. We also talk about the days before <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git,</a> when folks passed a hard drive around from hand to hand. The kids today have no idea how good they have it.</p>
